                    <p>Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe that’s beyond our own planet’s atmosphere.
                    <br> 
                    The planets in our own solar system, our own star the sun, and the bright stars can all be seen with 
                    the naked eye. However, astronomy can go much deeper, taking advantage of telescopes and other 
                    scientific instruments to study other stars and their planets in our galaxy, as well as distant 
                    galaxies beyond our own.
                    <br>
                    It can gather clues about the nature of the physical, chemical and biological universe itself.
                    <br/>
                    Modern astrologers attempt to do something similar, making predictions about human lives based 
                    on pseudoscience. Astrology is not a science. </p>

                    <img src="images/tips.jfif">
                    <p>Astronomers aren’t stargazers. Or, at least, there’s no longer any need for them to be. If you 
                    think an astronomer treks up mountains to spend night after night behind the eyepiece of a giant 
                    telescope, think again. These days telescopes can be controlled remotely, so it’s common for 
                    modern astronomers to simply make requests for observations and then download computer-generated 
                    data and images the next morning for their analysis. That includes space telescopes like the 
                    Hubble Space Telescope.
                    <br />
                    People very often confuse astronomy with astrology. Every professional astronomer has had to hear 
                    someone say to them, "so you’re an astrologer, right?" Astrology and astronomy are not the same thing, but they used to be. Observational astronomy can be traced back to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia as far back as 3,000 B.C., but the calculating of solar eclipses, the movements of the planets and theories about how the night sky works was the job of ancient astrologers who presumed that celestial events and alignments had a direct impact on human affairs.

                    <img src="images/opo.jpg">
                    <p>All astronomy is the study of different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, which 
                    comprises radio, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma rays. To get the 
                    full picture of what’s out there astronomers need to study various wavelengths of light. 
                    <br>
                    <p>Optical astronomy is the study of celestial objects using telescopes and in visible light; 
                    all of the biggest telescopes on Earth are optical. Infrared light can be detected outside of 
                    the Earth’s atmosphere, so by space-based observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope and 
                    the James Webb Space Telescope. Radio astronomy is the study of the sky in radio frequencies; 
                    radio telescopes detect and amplify radio waves from space.</p>

                    <img src="images/bb.jpg">
                    <p>However they observe the universe, astronomers only ever get a snapshot of the planets, stars 
                    and galaxies they study. So although there are dozens of different branches of astronomy, in practice
                    many of them must overlap for an astronomer to get as full a picture as possible of objects that 
                    exist for millions to billions of years.
                    <br>
                    We’re on the cusp of some tremendously exciting new technology that looks set to revolutionize 
                    astronomy. The most obvious is the James Webb Space Telescope, which from 2022 will probe the cosmos to uncover the history of the universe. 
                    <br>
                    Though just as exciting is the Vera Rubin Observatory all-sky survey and the a new generation 
                    of massive ground-based telescopes like the Extremely Large Telescope, which should all see 
                    ‘first light’ in the mid-2020s. The Square Kilometre Array, the world’s largest radio telescope, 
                    should also be operating by the late 2020s. 
                    <br>
                    Astronomers are about to see deeper into space to observe regions and objects never seen before.</p>
