                    <img src="images/big bang.gif">
                    <p>The Big Bang Theory is the leading explanation for how the universe began. Simply put, 
                    it says the universe as we know it started with an infinitely hot and dense single point 
                    that inflated and stretched — first at unimaginable speeds, and then at a more measurable 
                    rate — over the next 13.8 billion years to the still-expanding cosmos that we know today.
                    <br>
                    Existing technology doesn't yet allow astronomers to literally peer back at the universe's 
                    birth, much of what we understand about the Big Bang comes from mathematical formulas and 
                    models. Astronomers can, however, see the "echo" of the expansion through a phenomenon known 
                    as the cosmic microwave background.
                    <br>
                    While the majority of the astronomical community accepts the theory, there are some theorists
                    who have alternative explanations besides the Big Bang — such as eternal inflation or an 
                    oscillating universe.</p>

                    Around 13.7 billion years ago, everything in the entire universe was condensed in an infinitesimally 
                    small singularity, a point of infinite denseness and heat. 
                    <br>
                    Suddenly, an explosive expansion began, ballooning our universe outwards faster than the speed
                    of light. This was a period of cosmic inflation that lasted mere fractions of a second — about 
                    10^-32 of a second, according to physicist Alan Guth’s 1980 theory that changed the way we 
                    think about the Big Bang forever.
                    <br>
                    When cosmic inflation came to a sudden and still-mysterious end, the more classic descriptions 
                    of the Big Bang took hold. A flood of matter and radiation, known as “reheating,” began 
                    populating our universe with the stuff we know today: particles, atoms, the stuff that would 
                    become stars and galaxies and so on.
                    <br>
                    This all happened within just the first second after the universe began, when the temperature 
                    of everything was still insanely hot, at about 10 billion degrees Fahrenheit (5.5 billion Celsius)
                    , according to NASA. The cosmos now contained a vast array of fundamental particles such as 
                    neutrons, electrons and protons — the raw materials that would become the building blocks for 
                    everything that exists today.</p>

                    <p>The CMB has been observed by many researchers now and with many spacecraft missions. One of the 
                    most famous space-faring missions to do so was NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) 
                    satellite, which mapped the sky in the 1990s.
                    <br>
                    Several other missions have followed in COBE's footsteps, such as the BOOMERanG experiment 
                    (Balloon Observations of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics), NASA's Wilkinson 
                    Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite.
                    <br>
                    Planck's observations, first released in 2013, mapped the CMB in unprecedented detail and 
                    revealed that the universe was older than previously thought: 13.82 billion years old, rather 
                    than 13.7 billion years old. The research observatory's mission is ongoing and new maps of 
                    the CMB are released periodically.
                    <br>
                    The maps give rise to new mysteries, however, such as why the Southern Hemisphere appears 
                    slightly redder (warmer) than the Northern Hemisphere. The Big Bang Theory says that the 
                    CMB would be mostly the same, no matter where you look.</p>
