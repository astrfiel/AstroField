                    <p>Galaxies are not scattered randomly throughout the universe, but are often found in 
                    "clusters," which are in turn parts of larger groupings called "super-clusters." How did 
                    these structures of the universe come about? Did the material that galaxies comprise come 
                    together first, giving birth to stars, or did stars form first, gravitating toward one 
                    another to form galaxies?
                    <br>
                    Astronomers in the latter half of the 20th century have made wondrous discoveries, expanding 
                    our understanding of the universe and our vision beyond the visible portion of the 
                    electromagnetic spectrum. Humanity's knowledge of how the cosmos was born and how its 
                    many phenomena arise has grown exponentially in a period of time equivalent to just one 
                    human lifetime. Nevertheless, despite these great strides, some fundamental questions remain 
                    largely unanswered, chief among them, how did the first galaxies form?
                    <br>
                    Our understanding on the origin of the universe is hampered by the lack of direct observations. 
                    In essence, astronomers are trying to put together a 10,000-piece puzzle from the dozen pieces 
                    found underneath the table that were chewed on by the cat. Much as archaeologists do, astronomers 
                    must peel away the strata of time to unearth clues to the birth of galaxies. As larger telescopes 
                    are built to observe fainter and more distant galaxies, we can probe further back in time. 
                    In recent years, astronomers have achieved great progress, peering farther out in space to 
                    study objects that existed when the universe was still very young. But no one has yet seen an 
                    epoch when galaxies did not exist. For that, we need to look back to a time when the universe 
                    was only a few hundred million years old, and look at nascent galaxies.</p>

                    <img src="images/hand.jpg">
                    <p>The theories of how it all started are based upon the scientific observations and reasearch 
                    of some of the brightest minds, yet these theories should not be construed as fact. There could 
                    be radical new developments that could dramatically change our understanding on the origins of 
                    the universe.
                    <br>
                    Given the current knowledge of mankind, it seems fairly reasonable that there may have been a 
                    Big Bang, the primeval explosion that brought all space and time, all matter and energy, into 
                    being. For several hundred thousand years immediately thereafter, the universe was too hot for 
                    elements to form, so it consisted of a mix of subatomic particles and radiation. As the universe 
                    cooled to the point where the matter became transparent to the radiation, the first hydrogen and 
                    helium atoms began to form. Images taken by NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer indicate that the 
                    featureless sea of cosmic particles and radiation now showed the first signs of structure. Were 
                    these subtle variations in an otherwise smooth universe the seeds that grew to form the first 
                    galaxies? We do not know; and for now, we can only hypothesize.
                    <br>
                    Some astronomers believe the universe was built with small pieces, such as gas clouds and star 
                    clusters, that merged over time to form galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Others theorize 
                    that the early universe broke first into colossal clumps that contained enough building 
                    materials to make structures on the grandest scale — great walls and sheets of millions of 
                    galaxies — that fragmented into increasingly smaller gas and clouds, ultimately resulting in 
                    individual galaxies.
                    <br>
                    In the first scenario, the Milky Way would have formed when star clusters merged to form the 
                    galaxy's bulge, or core, which then accreted more gas and dust to form its flattened disk of 
                    spiral arms. But, according to the second scenario, the Milky Way would have been born some 
                    time after a huge region of gas and dust began to condense into our local group of galaxies. 
                    Continued fragmentation would have produced increasingly smaller assemblies, finally spawning 
                    individual galaxies such as our Milky Way and its neighbors, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.
                    <br>
                    When astronomers study the Milky Way, they can learn about the birth, life and death of its 
                    stars because they see the stars at various evolutionary stages. Detailed studies of the ages 
                    and chemical compositions of these stars suggest that the Milky Way has led a relatively quiet 
                    existence, forming stars at a rate of a few suns per year for about the last 10 billion years. 
                    But while these stars offer clues to the age of our galaxy, they present little evidence that 
                    helps to explain how the Milky Way originally formed.</p>

                    <img src="images/mlk.gif">
                    <p>Looking beyond our galaxy with current telescopes, astronomers can study both middle-aged 
                    and mature galaxies. When NASA's Hubble Space Telescope was pointed at one tiny speck of sky 
                    for 10 days, the resulting image provided the most detailed view of the early universe ever 
                    obtained. The image contains a bewildering assortment: 1,500 galaxies at various stages of 
                    evolution, some dating back to the time when the universe was only a billion years old.
                    <br>
                    Within this deep-field image are recognizable shapes: spherical galaxies called ellipticals, 
                    reddish in color by virtue of their light from mature stars, and crystal blue spiral galaxies, 
                    blazing from the glow of their hot, young stars. There are also strange, "tadpole"-like objects, 
                    disturbed and apparently merging galaxies dubbed "train wrecks," as well as a multitude of 
                    faint, "dwarf" galaxies. Some of these objects may date back to the first generation of galaxies 
                    and stars. Did these cosmic shards and fragments evolve into today's recognizable galaxies? Are 
                    they as small as they appear, but bright from great bursts of star formation? Or, are they 
                    massive, with much of their stellar population hidden from view by clouds of dust?
                    <br>
                    The answers to these questions remain tantalizingly out of reach, so the mystery remains. 
                    Astronomers can only theorize about how density fluctuations in a sea of subatomic particles 
                    could have formed the great variety of galaxy shapes and sizes that make up the universe as 
                    we see it today. And understanding galaxy evolution is necessary for addressing the even more 
                    fundamental questions about the expansion of space and the ultimate fate of the universe.</p>
