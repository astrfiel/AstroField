                    <img src="images/st.jpg">
                    <p>The fabric of space-time is a conceptual model combining the three dimensions of space 
                    with the fourth dimension of time. According to the best of current physical theories, 
                    space-time explains the unusual relativistic effects that arise from traveling near the 
                    speed of light as well as the motion of massive objects in the universe.</p>

                <div class="post">
                    <h3 id="who">WHO DISCOVERED SPACE-TIME?</h3>
                    <p>The famous physicist Albert Einstein helped develop the idea of space-time as part of his 
                    theory of relativity. Prior to his pioneering work, scientists had two separate theories to 
                    explain physical phenomena: Isaac Newton's laws of physics described the motion of massive 
                    objects, while James Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic models explained the properties of 
                    light, according to NASA.
                    <br>
                    But experiments conducted at the end of the 19th century suggested that there was something 
                    special about light. Measurements showed that light always traveled at the same speed, 
                    no matter what. And in 1898, the French physicist and mathematician Henri Poincaré speculated 
                    that the velocity of light might be an unsurpassable limit. Around that same time, other 
                    researchers were considering the possibility that objects changed in size and mass, depending 
                    on their speed.
                    <br>
                    Einstein pulled all of these ideas together in his 1905 theory of special relativity, 
                    which postulated that the speed of light was a constant. For this to be true, space and 
                    time had to be combined into a single framework that conspired to keep light's speed the 
                    same for all observers. 
                    <br>
                    A person in a superfast rocket will measure time to be moving slower and the lengths of 
                    objects to be shorter compared with a person traveling at a much slower speed. That's because 
                    space and time are relative — they depend on an observer's speed. But the speed of light is 
                    more fundamental than either. 
                    <br>
                    The conclusion that space-time is a single fabric wasn't one that Einstein reached by himself. 
                    That idea came from German mathematician Hermann Minkowski, who said in a 1908 colloquium, 
                    "Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, 
                    and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality."
                    <br>
                    The space-time he described is still known as Minkowski space-time and serves as the 
                    backdrop of calculations in both relativity and quantum-field theory. The latter describes 
                    the dynamics of subatomic particles as fields, according to astrophysicist and science writer 
                    Ethan Siegel.</p>

                    <h3 id="how">HOW SPACE-TIME WORKS</h3>
                    <img src="images/spt.gif">
                    <p>Nowadays, when people talk about space-time, they often describe it as resembling a sheet 
                    of rubber. This, too, comes from Einstein, who realized as he developed his theory of 
                    general relativity that the force of gravity was due to curves in the fabric of space-time. 
                    <br>
                    Massive objects — like the Earth, sun or you — create distortions in space-time that cause 
                    it to bend. These curves, in turn, constrict the ways in which everything in the universe 
                    moves, because objects have to follow paths along this warped curvature. Motion due to gravity 
                    is actually motion along the twists and turns of space-time.
                    <br>
                    A NASA mission called Gravity Probe B (GP-B) measured the shape of the space-time vortex 
                    around the Earth in 2011 and found that it closely accords with Einstein's predictions.
                    <br>
                    But much of this remains difficult for most people to wrap their heads around. Although 
                    we can discuss space-time as being similar to a sheet of rubber, the analogy eventually 
                    breaks down. A rubber sheet is two dimensional, while space-time is four dimensional. 
                    It's not just warps in space that the sheet represents, but also warps in time. 
                    The complex equations used to account for all of this are tricky for even physicists to work with.</p>
